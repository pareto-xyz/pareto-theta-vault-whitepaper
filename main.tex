\begin{abstract}
Theta Vaults are a simple on-chain structured product that runs an automated strategy to sell rolling weekly out-the-money covered calls in which the premium is returned to vault participants as yield.
Traditionally, Theta Vaults face two main challenges: first, they require oracles which can introduce new vulnerabilities; second, the yield is capped by the efficiency of a matching process to find options buyers.
In this paper, we present the design for Theta Vaults built on top of replicating market makers that approximate a Black-Scholes covered call.
Beyond covered calls, an ecosystem of efficient and secure options vaults can be built by a similar replication.

\section{Preface}

This paper is a technical introduction to Pareto Replicating Theta Vaults, a redesign of the yield instrument popularized by Ribbon Finance. In the following, we describe how to construct Theta Vaults on top of replicating market makers (RMMs), in which selling a covered call is equivalent to being a liquidity provider. Our primary hypothesis is that the ability of RMMs to replicate a wide array of structured products can be used to design an options ecosystem with token compositionality as a first-class citizen. With regards to Theta Vaults in particular, RMMs offer a oracle-free and auction-free solution that users may find attractive. In the following sections, we first provide background information then present the mechanism underlying the Replicating Theta Vault (RTV).

\paragraph{[6/15/22]} The alpha product for Pareto RTVs is currently under development. Please reach out to \texttt{mike@paretolabs.xyz} if you have any questions.
